This repo contains a simple web page where you can gather gold by clicking a button.
After reaching 5 gold the pickaxe button becomes visible. The first pickaxe can
be purchased for 10 gold and each additional pickaxe costs double the previous
one while increasing the click multiplier from x2 to x3, x4 and so on.
Each time you search for gold the button enters a short half-second recharge period
before it can be clicked again. A small progress bar shows when the button is
ready.
Upon reaching 25 gold you can hire a worker who automatically generates
one gold every second. The current gold per second rate is shown next to
the gold counter.
