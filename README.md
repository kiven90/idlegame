This repo contains a simple web page where you can gather gold by clicking a button.
After collecting 10 gold, you can buy a pickaxe to double the gold gained per click.
Each time you search for gold the button enters a short one-second recharge period
before it can be clicked again. A small progress bar shows when the button is
ready.
Upon reaching 25 gold you can hire a worker who automatically generates
one gold every second. The current gold per second rate is shown next to
the gold counter.
